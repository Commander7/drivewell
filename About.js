        In early May, trade publication Drinks International (DI) released its
        list of the past year’s most popular cocktails around the globe. To
        create the annual ranking, DI surveys the world’s top bars and asks each
        to name its best-selling drinks for the year. The responses are then
        weighted and ranked. This year, the publication surveyed 100 bars from
        33 countries to create a roundup of the year’s most in-demand libations.
        The shoo-in classics like Martinis, Manhattans, and Old Fashioneds are
        all still present, but this year’s list saw a staggering number of
        cocktail debuts, particularly those in the gin and mezcal categories.
        Stagnation is boring, so it’s always nice to see some new talent.
